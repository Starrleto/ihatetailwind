Peer review: Jerrod Packard
Peer review comments: Nice website! I'm not familiar with Reigen Arataka, but he sounds very funny! I appreciated all of the humor in your site, it was fun to read through each page. I also appreciate the simplicity of your design. Very minimal, but very effective. Responsiveness is good, but I did notice the header image on your homepage got pretty small on mobile. Aside from that, everything else looks good. Well done Ellie!
